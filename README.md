# Boston-Airbnb-Data-Analysics
This semester, I participated in the data competition hold at Brandeis University,which was about Airbnb data analysics in Boston. Although 
at the end,I cannot enter the finals.I still learnt a lot from this experience.

This repository contains the Boston-Airbnb data set, visulizations codes,machine learning codes and final report.This is a basic machine 
learning project, expect to make adjustments in the future.
